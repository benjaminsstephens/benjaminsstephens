# Hi, Iâ€™m Ben.

I am a DPhil (PhD) student in Mathematics at the University of Oxford, working within the Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology (WCMB).  
My research focuses on developing mathematical models to better understand complex biological systems.

## Research Interests
- Mathematical modelling of biological processes  
- Differential equation models (ODEs, PDEs)  
- Agent-based modelling  
- Theoretical and computational biology  

---

## Tools & Languages
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, SymPy)   
- LaTeX  

---

## Current Work
I am currently building and analysing mathematical models that explore biological dynamics using differential equations and computational simulations.
